tellraw @s [{"text":"ðŸš€ GETTING STARTED","color":"aqua","bold":true}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"1. Plan your shots first","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Before placing any markers, walk through your scene and decide what you want to show. Think like a movie director!"}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"2. Start simple","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Begin with amount:0 and interpolate:none. Get your basic camera positions right before adding smoothing."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"3. Use particles to preview","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Always use the show particles command to visualize your path before playing the cutscene."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"4. Test with fast speed","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Use speed:10 for quick testing, then slow down to your final speed once you're happy with the path."}}]

tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Establish wide, then detail","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Start with wide establishing shots, then move closer for details. This is a classic film technique that works great in Minecraft."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Rule of thirds","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Don't always center your subject. Position important elements along the edges of your view for more dynamic shots."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Lead the eye","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Use camera movement to guide the viewer's attention. Move from one interesting element to another."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Vary your heights","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Don't keep the camera at eye level. Try high angles, low angles, and different elevations for visual interest."}}]

tellraw @s [{"text":"âš™ TECHNICAL BEST PRACTICES","color":"aqua","bold":true}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Smooth rotations matter","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Pay attention to where you're looking when placing points. Smooth rotation changes are just as important as smooth position changes."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Don't over-interpolate","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"You don't need interpolation on every point. Use it selectively where you need smooth movement."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Performance considerations","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"High interpolation amounts (15+) can cause lag. Test on your target hardware and adjust accordingly."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Backup your work","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Save copies of your world regularly. Cutscene deletion cannot be undone!"}}]

tellraw @s [{"text":"ðŸŽ­ COMMON CUTSCENE TYPES","color":"aqua","bold":true}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Fly-through tours","color":"green","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Use curve_y interpolation with moderate speed (40-60 ticks). Great for showcasing builds or landscapes."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Character introductions","color":"blue","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Start wide, move closer, circle around. Use slow speed (60-80 ticks) to build atmosphere."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Action sequences","color":"red","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Fast speed (10-20 ticks), minimal interpolation. Quick cuts between different angles of the action."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Dialogue scenes","color":"yellow","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Medium speed (30-50 ticks), focus on faces and reactions. Use line interpolation for subtle movement."}}]

tellraw @s [{"text":"ðŸ›  TROUBLESHOOTING","color":"aqua","bold":true}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Choppy movement?","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Increase interpolation amount or check that your rotation changes aren't too extreme between points."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Camera too fast?","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Increase speed value. Remember: higher speed = slower movement (more ticks per point)."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Lag during playback?","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Reduce interpolation amounts, or break long cutscenes into shorter segments."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Wrong final rotation?","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Make sure you're looking in the right direction when placing your final cutscene point."}}]

tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Use functions for effects","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Add particle effects, sounds, or other commands to enhance your cutscenes using the functions system."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Layer multiple cutscenes","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Create different cutscenes for different purposes: overview, detail shots, character focus, etc."}}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"â€¢ Study real films","color":"white","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":"Watch movies and pay attention to camera movement. Many techniques translate well to Minecraft cutscenes."}}]
